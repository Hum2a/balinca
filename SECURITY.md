# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within our project, please send an email to security@example.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- Location of the affected source code
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Security Features Implemented

Our application includes several security features to protect user data and ensure secure operation:

### Authentication & Authorization

- Strong password policy with complexity requirements
- Rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute force attacks
- Session timeout for inactive users
- Firebase Security Rules for granular permission control
- Authentication state validation

### Data Protection

- Client-side encryption for sensitive data before storage
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- CSRF protection for all forms and API requests
- Secure headers with Content Security Policy

### Network Security

- HTTPS enforcement
- Strict Transport Security headers
- Secure cookie configuration
- Referrer Policy enforcement

### Error Handling & Logging

- Error boundary for graceful error handling
- Security event logging for audit trails
- Sanitized error messages (no leakage of sensitive information)
- Rate limiting on API requests

### Third-Party Integration Security

- API request timeout and retry mechanisms
- Secure handling of API keys
- Validation of external data

## Security Best Practices for Development

When contributing to this project, please adhere to the following security practices:

1. **Never commit sensitive information** (API keys, passwords, private keys) to the repository
2. **Always validate user input** on both client and server sides
3. **Keep dependencies updated** and regularly audit for vulnerabilities
4. **Follow the principle of least privilege** when setting up permissions
5. **Use parameterized queries** for database operations to prevent injection attacks
6. **Implement proper error handling** to avoid information disclosure
7. **Test security measures** with automated and manual tests

## Security Configuration

The project uses several security configuration files:

- `firestore.rules` - Firebase Firestore security rules
- `storage.rules` - Firebase Storage security rules
- `public/.htaccess` - Web server security configurations
- `public/index.html` - Contains Content Security Policy

## Ongoing Security Maintenance

Our security approach includes:

1. **Regular dependency audits** using `npm audit`
2. **Static code analysis** for potential vulnerabilities
3. **Environment separation** for development, testing, and production
4. **Regular backups** of critical data
5. **Incident response planning** for potential security breaches
